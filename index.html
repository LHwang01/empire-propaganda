            As a new recruit, you will receive official empire military training, standard issue, white plastoid storm trooper armor,
            an E-11 medium blaster rifle, a customizable storm trooper dog tag, and, the most important of all, the power to bring
            freedom, justice, and peace to our empire.

            <br>
            <br>

            Work hard and you can move your way up the ranks and obtain new equipment and benefits, such as becoming an incinerator trooper, a 
            scout trooper, or even the prestiguous death trooper.

            Don't want to enlist but want to do your job as a citizen of the Empire? If you spot someone you suspect to be a Jedi, or if you hear
            treasonous talk of supporting the Jedi or the rebel cause, immediately note the name (and address, if possible) of the traitor
            and report it to either a storm trooper patroller or to your local Empire outpost.
